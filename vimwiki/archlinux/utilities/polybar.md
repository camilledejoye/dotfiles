## [PulseAudio Control](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/polybar-pulseaudio-control)

Better looking that `pa-applet`.  
The packages `pulseaudio` and `pavucontrol` will be needed:
```sh
pacman -S pulseaudio pavucontrol
```

The script is already present in the dotfiles so there is no need to configure anything.
