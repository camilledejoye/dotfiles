# [Picom](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Picom)

Lightweight compositor for X, forks of compton which seems unmaintained.

## Installation

```sh
pacman -S picom
```

## Configuration

The configuration should already be in the dotfiles repository, to start fresh:
```sh
cp /etc/xdg/picom.conf ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
```
